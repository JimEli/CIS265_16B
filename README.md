# Pima CC CIS265 Week #16 Project B

(C99) Write a program that converts a complex number in Cartesian coordinates to polar form. The user will enter a and b (the real and imaginary parts of the number); the program will display the values of r and theta.

Notes:
* Because of the different handling of complex numbers between MSVC and GNU, I decide to write the program for both.
* Compiled with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141) and eclipse GNU GCC 5.3.0, using C language options.
